It's been a while since I updated this, but it still works pretty well! Plans for this plugin are uncertain. The "in" thing right now isn't jQuery, but I do still love it.

Anyways, plans for this are to refactor everything. Move the CSS to SCSS. Move the JS to something build-worthy. Add the ability to add an array of locations. All will coming with a major update.

Until then, make sure to be kind. Love ya'll.
