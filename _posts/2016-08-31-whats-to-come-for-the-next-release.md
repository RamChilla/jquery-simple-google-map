The Simple Map jQuery plugin is meant to be easy, fast, and sustainable. Currently, it is a bare bones release, with just the essentials to get you started.

Plans for the plugin are as follows:
* Include ability to bypass geocoding and provide coordinates directly
* More overlay options (requires CSS)
* SCSS source for siimpler overlay styling and theming
* Multiple locations (coordinate mode only)
* General code improvement.
* General naming improvement.
