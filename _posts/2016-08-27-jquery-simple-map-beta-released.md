jQuery Simple Map is a plugin created out of necessity. Almost all the Google Map jQuery plugins are really rich, and are packed with a lot of features. They are great tools with lots of options. However, they lack simplicity.

This plugin is meant to solve that problem. SGM provides just the essential features, and makes it extremely quick to **geocode an address and render a Google Map**.

You can find more information on the [usage](/usage) and [options](/options) pages. If you are looking for a more robust and granular plugin, try&hellip;
* [gmaps.js](https://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/)
* [maplace.js](http://maplacejs.com/)
* [gmap3](http://gmap3.net/)

Hopefully, you find this plugin useful, simple, &amp; powerful. Let me know what you think.
